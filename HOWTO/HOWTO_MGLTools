During the installation of MGL_Tools, script is asking for licensing. If X terminal is not enabled, this
message will not be seen and installation script will hang. To enable X terminal, perform the following:


export DISPLAY=localhost:0 #to enable answering on licensing question


MGL_Tools by default do not work with molecules having metal ions. To enable this functionality,su as a root
and perform:


chmod o+w $MGLTOOLS $MGLTOOLS2

chmod o+w $MGLTOOLS/AD4_parameters.dat $MGLTOOLS/AD4_parameters.dat


By the first start of Vini, parameters for metal ions will be added to AD4_parameters.dat files.
