SWISS-MODEL_Repository Export

This is a set metadata for all the structures (homology models and experimental structures)
found in SWISS-MODEL_Repository for Homo sapiens. 

There are two index files, in tab separated format called INDEX and in JSON format called INDEX.json. 

To retrieve the coordinate files, download the files individually using the URL found in the 
"url" column. Otherwise, you could try downloading the large dump file containing all the coordinates.
